I normally limit my online presence to [twitter](http://www.twitter.com/viktorasm) and forums (if you're meeting `uiron` on [cgtalk.com](http://www.cgtalk.com), [helifreak.com](http://www.helifreak.com) or somewhere else, that's probably me). I'm also an author and maintainer of projects [ngSkinTools](http://www.ngskintools.com) and [never-crashed.com](http://www.never-crashed.com).

I've been having ideas for a few articles now and then, and somehow randomly decided to give Github pages a try. We'll see where this goes.
